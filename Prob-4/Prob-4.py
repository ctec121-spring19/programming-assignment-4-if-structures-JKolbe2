"""
The Elgorte coffee shop sells coffee at $16.50 a pound
plus the cost of shipping. Each order ships for $0.76
per pound plus $1.25 fixed cost for overhead. If the
number of pounds of the coffee order exceeds 10, then
the shipping cost is waived. Write a program that
calculates the cost of an order. Name your function
coffeeProcessor()
